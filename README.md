## Deploy to GitHub Pages (jeevak-hospital-website)

This repo is configured to deploy to GitHub Pages at `https://nirnimes.github.io/jeevak-hospital-website`.

Steps:

1. Ensure your repository is named `jeevak-hospital-website` under the `nirnimes` account.
2. Push to the `main` branch. A workflow `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` builds the app and publishes `dist/` to Pages.
3. In GitHub, go to Settings â†’ Pages and set Source to "GitHub Actions" if not already.

Local preview:

```sh
npm ci
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Notes:
- Vite `base` is set to `/jeevak-hospital-website/` for correct asset paths on Pages.
- `public/404.html` redirects unknown routes back to the SPA entry.
